      <description>A very early idea for a responsive and dynamic start page that should open for default on the browser.
 It should list some news with RSS Maybe some email information as well Would be nice to list some hardware info like remote drive space  </description>

 Integration with Flickr Restricted access to some areas (so far, looks like it&amp;rsquo;s not possible) Some blog content  </description>
