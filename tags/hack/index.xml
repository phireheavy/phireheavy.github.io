        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years working from home it felt good to finally return to working in a physical office with people again. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat temporary and kind of scary to be around people, it gave me a fresh perspective on work. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to admit it but i&amp;rsquo;m not that productive working exclusively from home. It remains to be seen what kind of schedule i can adopt between office and home, but for now it feels good to have a little more contact with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for work, i am now a certified &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Power BI Data Analyst Associate&lt;/a&gt; and also a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.qualtrics.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Qualtrics Research Core Expert&lt;/a&gt;. I work most of the time inside Power BI, and in sysadmin tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently i took an interest in the pentesting and redteaming subjects, and i&amp;rsquo;m working through the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hackthebox.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hack the Box&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tryhackme.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TryHackMe&lt;/a&gt; challenges. I find it very challenging but fun. I like the idea of hacking and working through these challenges, like they were puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
