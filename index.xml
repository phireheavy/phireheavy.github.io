      <description>Most to-do and objetive tracking apps are either too cumbersome or too simple, both of which put me off from using them. I tend to revert to an excel file where i can name a task, prioritize it, write a few notes, set a date and routinely update a percentage to indicate how much of a certain task is done. My challenge is to build an app with a free backend so i can use it anywhere.</description>

      <description>This is an attempt to establish some sort of AI programming routines in order to classify strings of text as positive/negative or neutral. The objetive is to find if such a thing is possible with C#, how hard is it and what kind of resources will be needed.

      <description>You can often find me outside with one or more cameras around, trying to get that perfect shot. I commonly use:
Nikon D5100, with the 18-55 kit lens or the 35mm 1.8f lens
 This is my main camera and the one that i most enjoy using. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most modern but it has enough features and quality and i&amp;rsquo;m not planning on getting rid of it anytime soon.  Sony DSC HX60V</description>

      <description>This is a project abandoned by a client but i have decided to finish it myself. It is a small social network oriented to allow users to comment on various topics or products. The objetive was to have several discussions rooms where one supervisor or admin would launch a topic of discussion and then he/she would create teams based on gender, age and location. The users would then be allowed to voice their opinions on the matter at hand.</description>

      <description>I love the idea of making some sort of digital game that could be played by a group of people in person. This is a very early concept for a trivia game where one user would build a quiz with a number of questions. Then they would invite other players to play. One user would ask the questions and the others would play, either individually or on teams. Since this would be a multiplayer game there are a number of technologies that would have to implemented, along with a number of decisions:</description>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s this site. This is made using the Hugo framework and is hosted on Porkbun. I find that the static content generator is a great tool to use for personal and small sites, but as any project, this is a work in progress. It&amp;rsquo;s still missing:

Read on through all the sections to find out what i&amp;rsquo;m up to.
