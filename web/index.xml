      <description>This is an application of the Beautiful Soup library in Python. I used it to get and store a number of posts from a well known portuguese message board. All the posts would be separated in content, user, section, url and an unique identifier.
Python is somewhat weird to use for someone like me who is more experienced in C# and Java but i can see why it has such a following for developers still learning.</description>

      <description>A very early idea for a responsive and dynamic start page that should open for default on the browser.
 It should list some news with RSS Maybe some email information as well Would be nice to list some hardware info like remote drive space  </description>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s this site. This is made using the Hugo framework and is hosted on Porkbun. I find that the static content generator is a great tool to use for personal and small sites, but as any project, this is a work in progress. It&amp;rsquo;s still missing:
 Integration with Flickr Restricted access to some areas (so far, looks like it&amp;rsquo;s not possible) Some blog content  </description>
