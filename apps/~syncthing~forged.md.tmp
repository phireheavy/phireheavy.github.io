Most to-do and objetive tracking apps are either too cumbersome or too simple, both of which put me off from using them. I tend to revert to an excel file where i can name a task, prioritize it, write a few notes, set a date and routinely update a percentage to indicate how much of a certain task is done. My challenge is to build an app with a free backend so i can use it anywhere.

In short, this app should support:

- Tasks, each of them with a name, description, priority, responsible user, due date and percentage of completion
  - Tasks can have subtasks, which are in itself (you guessed it!) tasks

For now, i'm researching the viability of using Google Firebase for the backend.

I have built the first steps of this app which include a login screen, a firebase app and connection between these two, which seems to be working. The next step is to define the database structure on the firebase side of things.
