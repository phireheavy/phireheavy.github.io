                <p>This is a project abandoned by a client but i have decided to finish it myself. It is a small social network oriented to allow users to comment on various topics or products. The objetive was to have several discussions rooms where one supervisor or admin would launch a topic of discussion and then he/she would create teams based on gender, age and location. The users would then be allowed to voice their opinions on the matter at hand. The best way to go about building such an app would be to have two separate components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A backend, in the form of a REST Api, built for this example in .Net Core 3.1 with Entity Framework</li>
<li>A mobile app, built in native Android with Kotlin</li>
<li>A SQL Database</li>
</ol>
<p>The client decided that it would be simpler and faster to find something pre-made.</p>

<ul>
<li>Backend is built and tested, although in a very basic form.
<ol>
<li>It has no validation or authentication. And it probably never will, as this will be used for learning and proof of concept.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Mobile App has yet to be started.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2020-08-20">2020-08-20</h5>
<ul>
<li>Mobile App is underway. I have built the first stages of an Android App, using Kotlin. Right now, i can access the API from the android emulator, and list data in a RecyclerView. This serves as proof of concept and will also enable me to copy and adapt the code for the users and messages sections.</li>
<li>Still working on:
<ul>
<li>Layout of the RecyclerView</li>
<li>Posting of new topics and new messages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
