[{"content":"Almost 2 years to the date i update this post with what is my current setup.\nHardware I have replaced the Lenovo Thinkpad T430s with a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 which i chose based on what it weights. It is what i use most of the time for work.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also replaced the Trackball with the most current version of the Logitech MX Ergo, mostly because it is bluetooth enabled. I\u0026rsquo;ve also purchased on a whim a Ducky ONE 2 Mini which has rekindled my taste for smaller keyboards and is currently my main keyboard.\nI also got into flight sims and driving sims. The flying is done using a VKB Gladiator NXT and a Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog Dual Throttle. Driving is accomplished using a Thrustmaster T300 Ferrari Edition with the TH8A shifter. I\u0026rsquo;ve also added a basic usb 3.0 hub from Amazon to connect all of this.\nI also acquired an used Oxygen 25 MK IV for which i\u0026rsquo;m still trying to find the time to explore.\nSoftware I\u0026rsquo;ve taken an interest in Cybersecurity for which i assigned my old laptop to run Kali Linux exclusively. I live inside Notion, Todoist and VS Code.\n","date":"2024-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.phireheavyindustries.com\"/p/how-i-work-i-2024/","title":"How i work i 2024"},{"content":"Board URL: https://forum.hackthebox.com/t/official-photobomb-discussion/265724\nBox URL: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Photobomb\nCreated: November 11, 2022 10:00 PM\nHost: photobomb.htb\nIP: 10.10.11.182\nInitial Scan Running a nmap scan shows only port 22 and 80 open.\nnmap 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Starting Nmap 7.92 ( [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org/) ) at 2022-11-11 21:57 WET Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.182 Host is up (0.043s latency).

It is a 3rd party battery, as this laptop is the better part of 10 years old. For that same reason i didn\u0026rsquo;t bother checking if there was anything blocking the use of 3rd party batteries. You can imagine my surprise when i was greeted with a message just after the bios check, stating an error with the battery not being original and that it was unable to charge. Booting to windows revealed a similar message and confirmed that the battery was indeed, not charging.\nAfter a quick google search, it became apparent that this is a feature implemented as a security measure against low quality or fake batteries. As most things, tt is also a subject of much controversy. Fortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s a patch that enables the use of a 7 row classic keyboard and disables the check for the original battery. The procedure is straightforward, involving a bios downgrade and then patching the bios with a modified image built in linux. And while i am, in theory, against downgrading in general, this was a no-brainer.\nAfter the patch, the laptop boots without an error message. It took almost 40 minutes, but started to slowly charge the battery. I also tested how much time could it run on the battery after fully charged, and was again surprised with a time just above 6 hours. Although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the most realistic test, i\u0026rsquo;m happy to get even half that working on some documents and checking my email.\n","date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.phireheavyindustries.com\"/p/downgrading/","title":"Downgrading"},{"content":"I just love trading tips with other people on what methods they use to organize their work and their life. Although i think this is a constant struggle i tend to see it as an opportunity for self improvement, and what methods can one use to achieve more efficient ways of getting stuff done.\nHardware I have 3 computers that i use on a daily basis. One is a Lenovo Thinkpad T430s. It is what i use for my daily work, connected to a VPN and to a Windows Domain. It is an old machine, which i bought refurbished and the battery on a good day might last 30 minutes. Nevertheless, it has been such a dependable machine that even when the inevitable upgrade happens, i might just keep it as a backup. It has a couple of SSDs, 8 GB of ram and not much else. It struggles with a couple of Power BI reports open but can handle a Kali VM, Outlook and a couple of RDP sessions with no issue. It can also run factorio, which is the only game i really need. I got it on a whim, after attending a training session where i was the only one without a company laptop (which i still do not have).\nI also have an MSI Dominator 6QD, with 16 GB of ram, an I7 cpu and a Geforce GTX970. This is where i do most studying, researching and writing. It is also my go to machine whenever i might stay away for a few days. It is a heavy laptop and not the most reliable machine but it\u0026rsquo;s powerful enough for anything that i might think to throw at it.\nFinally i have a desktop computer which has been built over the years as a media center / gaming machine. It has 24 GB of ram, a bunch of disks and two Geforce 970GTX. It handles everything that i need except for the most demanding games.\nFor the laptops if i\u0026rsquo;m commuting i\u0026rsquo;ll also have a trackball with me (usually a Logitech M570). At my home i have an assortment of mechanical keyboards, one of them being an IBM Model M which i find myself using more and more. A Razer Deathadder is still going strong despite most mice only lasting me a couple of years. The desktop uses a couple of screens, which i really don\u0026rsquo;t remember the model but work just fine. I also have a Technics amplifier hooked up to this desktop and a couple of JBL speakers. It is the definition of overkill but i don\u0026rsquo;t care and can\u0026rsquo;t really see getting rid of it anytime soon. If i need to have some sort of zoom or teams meeting, i\u0026rsquo;ll throw on a Razer headset and a generic webcam.\nStill in the sound department i have a couple of earbuds that i can connect to my Honor 10 and listen to spotify, youtube or podcasts. I\u0026rsquo;m also a fan of radio and sometimes i\u0026rsquo;ll throw a XHDATA D-808 SW Radio in my backpack. I also have a Samsung smartwatch which i use to check notifications and track my (poor) fitness.\nI usually have with me at least a fountain pen, a mechanical pencil and a notepad. Currently it\u0026rsquo;s a TWSBI Eco, an Ohto Super Promecha and a Leuchtterm 1917 bullet journal. For me, writing with a pen and paper is the best way to learn and understand any given subject.\nSoftware Most of my time is spent inside Power BI, Excel, Word and Outlook. Firefox is my default browser, with Bitwarden for password management. I use Virtualbox to spin up virtual machines for testing and fun. At work i use Windows 10 on workstations and Server 2016 on the VMs that support the users. These are hosted on a cloud with VMWare with our provider.\nI try to keep an updated todo list with Todoist and a personal knowledge base with Notion. I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting with Obsidian as a i like the idea of local files and markdown syntax. As most of what i write (including this post) is done inside VSCode i\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to consolidate most of these things into a single tool. I also have a Habitica account for habits tracking, which i don\u0026rsquo;t use as much as i should. Most of the stuff at work is organized in several copies of word and excel files, an approach that i hate but have been unable to change.\nOnedrive and Google Drive work great for syncing files between different machines. I have a couple of batch files for backups of my photos and development projects that get copied to a network drive. Development projects also live in github and photos get uploaded to google photos.\nTodo I think most of my limitations come from a lack of time and organization and when i\u0026rsquo;m not working or researching a subject i\u0026rsquo;m usually trying to improve this. Having a light laptop would also help, but only if it can run Factorio.\n","date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.phireheavyindustries.com\"/p/how-i-work/","title":"How i work"},{"content":"After a couple of years working from home it felt good to finally return to working in a physical office with people again.

I tend to revert to an excel file where i can name a task, prioritize it, write a few notes, set a date and routinely update a percentage to indicate how much of a certain task is done. My challenge is to build an app with a free backend so i can use it anywhere.\nIn short, this app should support:\nTasks, each of them with a name, description, priority, responsible user, due date and percentage of completion Tasks can have subtasks, which are in itself (you guessed it!) tasks For now, i\u0026rsquo;m researching the viability of using Google Firebase for the backend.\nUsed Resources I\u0026rsquo;ve been following these tutorials:\nFirebase Firestore Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d-gIPGzmK4\nLearn How to Build an Android 10 App - Using Kotlin - Development Masterclass 7+ hours FREE Course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRyvNKRkwbs\nKotlin Firebase Messenger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihJGxFu2u9Q\nAlthough it is somewhat outdated and uses the realtime database, for most of the UI interactions it was very informative.\nStatus Almost done, deciding on wether to finish it or move on Features missing: editing any of the fields of a task adding a percentage that would indicate how much of a task is left grouping tasks by tags creation and management of tags statistics on tags creating tasks for other users filtering tasks by date, percentage reminders and notifications about tasks on the due date 2020-08-30 I have built the first steps of this app which include a login screen, a firebase app and connection between these two, which seems to be working. The next step is to define the database structure on the firebase side of things.\n2020-09-09 This app is mostly done. I have a few remarks about this experience:\nThe user registration and authentication using the firebase auth module is very straightforward and easy to use The modeling of the data in firebase is weird, mostly because it goes against of much of what i know. Specifically, a hierarchy is discouraged as it would add more database operations and would increase the size of the data being transmitted between client and server, which has an impact on the value that an app would cost by being hosted on firebase. due to this i ended up following a few tips like (this)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58003147/how-to-structure-recurring-tasks-for-an-user-on-firestore] in order to have a flat table design kotlin is somewhat complicated and not very intuitive running the android emulator is buggy, i had to clean the cache and reboot the emulator multiple times screenshots login screen\ntask list screen\nnew task screen\n","date":"2020-08-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.phireheavyindustries.com\"/p/forged/","title":"Forged"},{"content":"This is an attempt to establish some sort of AI programming routines in order to classify strings of text as positive/negative or neutral.

It is a small social network oriented to allow users to comment on various topics or products. The objetive was to have several discussions rooms where one supervisor or admin would launch a topic of discussion and then he/she would create teams based on gender, age and location. The users would then be allowed to voice their opinions on the matter at hand. The best way to go about building such an app would be to have two separate components:\nA backend, in the form of a REST Api, built for this example in .Net Core 3.1 with Entity Framework A mobile app, built in native Android with Kotlin A SQL Database The client decided that it would be simpler and faster to find something pre-made.\nUsed Resources I\u0026rsquo;ve been following these tutorials:\n.NET Core 3.1 MVC REST API https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmvcAzHpsk8\nLearn How to Build an Android 10 App - Using Kotlin - Development Masterclass 7+ hours FREE Course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRyvNKRkwbs\nStatus 2020-08-10 Backend is built and tested, although in a very basic form.
