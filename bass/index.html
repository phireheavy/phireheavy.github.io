<h3 id="basses">Basses</h3>
<p>I currently have two basses:</p>
<p><a href="https://europe.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/guitars_basses/el_basses/trbx/500series.html#product-tabs">Yamaha TRBX505</a> which i bought used. It is a 5 string model and has a toggle switch for active and passive modes. It is a lovely piece of gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://harleybenton.com/product/jb-75-na/">Harley Benton</a>. A cheap bass but i felt i needed a 4 string and more convencional instrument. It is solid and good looking.</p>
<h3 id="pedals">Pedals</h3>
<p><a href="https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/multi-effects/bass-effects/b3/">Zoom B3</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sourceaudio.net/aftershock-bass-distortion.html">AfterShock Bass Distortion</a></p>
<p>Both of these pedals enable a wide range of sounds. I could spend hours discovering and tinkering with them.</p>
